24,"The best kind of love story is a self love story. You can trust me on that! I learned this hard lesson after being “metaphorically” stabbed in the back about 37 times by people I THOUGHT I could trust hahaha... but that’s all in the past! And I’m a better person for it! Way better person really. Better than them anyway... In fact I realized that the only person who could truly appreciate the incredible person that is me... is me!
