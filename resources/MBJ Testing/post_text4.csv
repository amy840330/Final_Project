Life gets better and special ❤️❤️❤️

24,"Wishing my brother @fatjoe a very blessed and amazing Birthday! Thank you for being one of the most loyal, truthful and honorable people on the planet. 
From selling my first couple of hats out of your store, to allowing me to direct one of your videos. You have always supported others in their effort to follow their dreams.
You will always be one of the reasons that I can say “Yesterday’s price is NOT TODAYS PRICE😂” 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Many more amazing years to come for you my friend.

25,"As a business owner, you won’t get too far without knowing who your customers are.

The fact is, your customers are the most important component to your business. With that said, the sooner you know who they are, the sooner you’ll be able to help resolve their pain points and resonate with them, both through your marketing efforts and through the products/services you’re selling.

If you haven’t pinpointed your customer base yet, set aside some time to do so. You’ll be one step ahead of your competitors once you do."
26,"Thank you for a brand new day filled with brand new opportunities 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾

27,"I’ve made plenty of mistakes as an entrepreneur, but it’s all part of the process.

In light of my mistakes, however, I wanted to come up with a way where I could help other entrepreneurs avoid making the same mistakes. That’s when the idea for Daymond on Demand was born.

Daymond on Demand is full of interactive courses that will help you learn about everything from starting and scaling your business to mastering social media.

I hope each and every one of you benefits from this and that it sets you up to be in a better position than when you started.
