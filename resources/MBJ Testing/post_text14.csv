3,"(Forgive our Spanglish) -A circuit to give those abs exactly what they need (when it comes to working out)

5,"And now WHAT??🤷🏼‍♀️🧐
-Tips and tricks!! Training with light weights is easy, but as you develop and are ready for heavier weights.: ""How do I get these heavy weights into the position without dropping them on the floor… or straight in my face?""
There are many ways, but remember this is MY way to do this. 
-I'd love to hear your way… we can learn from each other: Feel free to comment below your own way :)
😍Outfits from @one0one_101 😍"
6,"No matter if you are getting rid of flabby overarms, or building triceps in general, the basic is the same: the ""pushing away"" movement is the way to go. Sometime heavy with few reps, sometimes light with a lot of reps. Keep changing your workouts constantly for best results.

Here I have a program for you to get an excellent triceps workout.
Today you can do this as a routine (4 sets), and next triceps day do this as a circuit (if the gym is not too crowded), and do the circuit 4 times.

12,"I mean where do I really even start 😅 these last few days have been absolutely crazy, it’s surreal! We moved into our dream house on Sunday, I’ve got a lot to say about that but I will save it for a YouTube video lol. 

The packing and moving just drains you, I don’t feel my normal self yet, the last few days have been us sorting things out in the house. Although we have a tonne of furniture being delivered over the next month, we’ve still been back and forth from stores buying everything from camera surveillance systems to leaf blowers 😅

Yesterday we had 3 meetings at the house back to back, gym architect for the gym I’m building in the back yard (it’s going to be huge 🙌🏾) landscaper to work on the whole estate and a painter who will be doing both the interior and exterior of the house. 

Due to all this I’ve been absent on socials, but I’ll be clawing my way back, new YouTube vid will be up tomorrow. I’ll also be announcing the winners of the last @elimin8challenge you have to join the next one! 👌🏾

That’s it for now ✌🏾

17,"First time bench pressing in over a month 😅 I’ve been messing with machines the last few weeks which has been great, but in order to maintain/improve bench pressing strength one must actually bench press lol. 

Had some decent sets, strength isn’t far off where I left it, these were just 2 of the many sets I did, which included a couple sets of 405 & 415. For those that will ask what my max is, when I’m feeling my best 425 will move for a double, so I’ll be working back to that. The most I’ve done in recent times is 445 😳 but that’s coming up to almost a year ago now, and we all know how we feel when we hear I used to…😴lol
