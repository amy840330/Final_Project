Ask yourself today- What’s your dream? Who else believes in you? And what is holding you back? 
Take a minute to dream today and make sure you accompany that dream with action…no matter how small the action may be. Trust me, you will be surprised how far it will take you.

1,"Thank you @tiffanyhaddish for sending me this story 😂

I was cracking up when listening to it, but in a larger sense, her experience shows that not only is FUBU meaningful to our customers, but it’s also a way to bring people together who may not know what we stand for.

Sure, it served as a way to get a conversation started, but the discussion that Tiffany had with this guy was centered around FUBU being black-owned and truly for the community, and it’s so impactful to us that she remembers this story and sent it our way.

Who else has a story like this where your brand left an impact on someone who told you about it years later? Share it below 👇🏾"
