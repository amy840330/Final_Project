0,"Back at the wheel of an SF90! With @bannedauto and @philwilson I'm checking out this stunning Assetto Fiorano car and thinking about the final spec I'll opt for mine, which actually needs to be locked next month. I'm also delighted to say that again the car has impressed me, I think it's one of the very best supercars currently on the market, mixing insane performance with new technology in such a seamless way. Needless to say, I'm quite excited about it! #Ferrari #SF90 #futureshmeemobile #AssettoFiorano #BannedAuto #LAcars #Shmee150"
1,"It's a P1 kinda day! Out for a drive in @supercarsteven's newly purchased Ice Silver P1, in a double convoy with @ct2go's full carbon P1 too. Does make me wonder about P1 vs Senna, two very different Ultimate Series cars in their approach, and still remarkable how game changing the P1 was when presented nearly 9 years ago! #McLaren #P1 #McLarenP1 #testdrive #CarWeek #Shmee150"
2,"The beautiful 300SL Roadster is without a shadow of a doubt my dream classic car. Driving this particular example that's for sale with @mbclassiccenter, thanks to @mercedesbenzmuseum, while car spotting countless hypercars around Pebble Beach could not be better! Maybe one day for @theshmeemobiles, maybe one day... #Mercedes #300SL #PebbleBeach #CarWeek #testdrive #Shmee150"
3,"The breathtaking @bugatti Bolide at @thequailevents which is now going into production, there will be 40 of them made. This year had some awesome cars on show, with the new Lamborghini Countach also making its debut #Bugatti #Bolide #Quail #CarWeek #Shmee150"
4,"The new @astonmartinlagonda Valkyrie Spider has just launched and I've taken a first look to check it out and see how the new roof system works. There will be 85 units in total, and it features a 3 piece folding roof panel, with new dihedral doors but maintains the same epic powertrain and details. First look video is live on the channel right now! #AstonMartin #Valkyrie #ValkyrieSpider #firstlook #PebbleBeach #CarWeek #Shmee150"
5,"First stop at Car Week to check out the updated @czinger_vehicles 21C! Now the lap record holder at Laguna Seca, it features a wider body and even more aero, while still boasting a 2.88l TT V8 and 3 electric motors for 1,250hp while weighing just 1,250kg too. Uniquely it features inline tandem seating with a central position, and must make for the most extraordinary drive #Czinger #Czinger21C #CarWeek #Shmee150"
6,"Driving the stunning Porsche Targa 4S Heritage Design Edition thanks to @hgreglux in Miami! The details on this car are spectacular, and I actually would have bought one if allocations had been available, but today I'm taking my first proper look around it and going out for a drive, to see what I'm missing out on. Here in Florida, H Greg Lux actually have 3 of them for sale in different specs, this one in Cherry Red with a manual gearbox is my pick for sure #Porsche #911Targa #HeritageDesignEdition #testdrive #HGregLux #Miami #Shmee150"
7,"Randy @savagegarage has bought back his Pagani Huayra! I never saw it when he owned it before but what a car for him to have in the collection and actually drive as much as he does. Oh, that SLS Black Series is new too, good choice! #SavageGarage #Pagani #Huayra #Miami #Shmee150"
8,"Reunited with @theshmeemobiles lime green beast! Back in Miami for a quick stop before heading to California and Car Week for some crazy days ahead. It's so cool to be back with the GT500 after about 4 months where it's been tucked away in Florida, although sadly everything is too last minute to be able to get it across country for the events. That won't stop the fun though, it's great to be back! #Shelby #GT500 #Ford #Mustang #Shmeemobile #Shmee150"
9,"It's time! @theshmeemobiles AMG GT Black Series is being resprayed AMG Solarbeam Yellow, and I cannot wait to see how it looks. This was always the plan hence the choice of Graphite Grey Magno for the base as it's the easiest to work with. The transformation is being done by @chartwell_derby just as per my SLS BS respray to Mystic Blue and the repairs to my Senna before. Why not just order it like this you say? It wasn't an option, and believe me I tried. It was absolutely impossible to order the car (RHD UK allocation) in anything other than the standard 8 choices available so this is the only way. What about the value? Life is too short, I'm going to do many thousands of miles in this car for many years to come, reselling it is not in the plans. #Mercedes #AMG #GTBlackSeries #Shmeemobile #Shmee150"
10,"My AMG Black Series trio are finally together at @theshmuseum! It's a dream come true to have these three incredibly special cars in @theshmeemobiles collection and now for the first time all here following pickup of the SLS BS from @avantgarde_mb fully ready to go. After taking delivery of the GT BS and C63 BS recently, I've been itching to bring the SLS BS home and now need to start planning a tour to Affalterbach... #Mercedes #AMG #BlackSeries #Shmeemobile #TheShmuseum #Shmee150"
11,"Back to the old school, car spotting in London with @theshmeemobiles original V8 Vantage Roadster! It feels like a decade ago, enjoying the Aston, and filming Aventadors, they just changed from the original LP700-4 to the SVJs! Plus, found a Huayra Roadster and LaFerrari too, all in my new video taking a walk down memory lane with a truly special car in my collection #Lamborghini #Aventador #SVJ #carspotting #AstonMartin #Vantage #Shmeemobile #londoncars #Shmee150"
12,"These are my two favorites. After the dually is done, I'm finishing the 73'... I can't stop looking at old photos and videos of it."
13,Yo! Dragon Rally XI is this weekend!!! An absolutely epic chance to run the dragon with the best drivers on the road (I'm not in that category üòÇ) but @smokymountaindrives_ go check them out!
14,"This shit is messed up, on a real note."
15,"Door still go up! 

We dropped a new podcast on WrapLife today with @atlantacustomwraps @killboydotcom and @mac_man_atl"
16,Late night creepin'
17,
18,"Yo, so Justin and I have been kicking around the idea of doing a raffle. Like, we fly you out and hang? Do some cool shit? Ride around in the mountains in supercars, etc ... But we wanna make sure that is something you guys would wanna do. That being said, does that sound like fun to y'all? We'd have a blast doing it, and I think some of you would too. Lemme know if we should."
19,"Swapped the door panels and dash, and now it's time to build the center console. Got a mini fridge for it too"
20,"""pull that up Jamie, let's see that"""
21,Still kinda hungry tho
22,"Back to chrome! I missed the all chrome centers, so I removed the dip."
23,"Looking at bikes on FB Marketplace and came across this gem ü§£ 

I'm not making fun of this dude. I get it; riding ain't for everyone! But I wanna be like, ""give It a few more tries!"" And then offer 2k less when he crashes it again ü§£"
