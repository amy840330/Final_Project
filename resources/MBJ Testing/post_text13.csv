0,The review is finally live! Let’s talk about the most ambitious phone of the year so far
1,"2 years of swipes and chip inserts, finally ordered a replacement Apple card. New resolution: Use physical cards as little as possible"
2,"This is one of those phones that has such high ambitions that it’s actually worse at some normal phone tasks while on the road to being able to do some things no other phones can do. I’ll explain more in the video, but for now… some pixels"
3,"Z Flip 3 I think is the first folding phone I can honestly start recommending to ""regular people"" (Also it kinda looks like a Pixel doesn't it?) - check out the new hands-on video to see why 👀"
4,"Meet the new water resistant, S-Pen supporting, selfie camera-hiding Z Fold 3! (can you spot the invisible selfie camera?) Video hands-on is now live on the channel!"
5,Only 144 days left to make 2021 great
6,PLAID’s wrap is done. It’s matte black and shadow. I don’t know why I ever led you guys to believe it might’ve gone differently 😅
7,Yo dawg. I heard you wanted official Pixel 6 info. So I got that for you. And Pixel 6 Pro. Check out the new video on the channel! I think this new Tensor chip will have a huge affect on the future of the Pixel line.
8,"Electric Hummer in the house 👀👀👀 Fun fact the windshield is so wide and short that it needs THREE windshield wipers.

Terrifying fact: It weighs over 9000 pounds and will still do 0-60 in 3 seconds. SHEESH"
9,Listen 😅

13,"YES I'M SMILING BUT MY ABS WERE ON FIRE! 😭😅🔥
On set shooting some more ab workouts from my new Cardio & Abs program earlier this week! 📸 🙌 One thing I have noticed is that I get SO many requests from people asking for 'ab finishes' to do AFTER their workouts because ab exercises were left behind....

Core strength is absolutely fundamental when working out, so it just made sense to make it a major part of my new HIIT Cardio & Abs program!

Not to mention, my FAVOURITE thing about core strength is that it will actually help you feel stronger when completing other exercises too! 🤩

There's no better feeling than feeling the burn in your core during a sweaty HIIT workout... and if you agree, then my new program is for YOU!

To try my new HIIT Cardio & Abs program, head to the link in my bio to use @Sweat's 7-day free trial today!

I'll see you there! 😊

14,"ARNA BEING THE CUTEST!!! 
That's it . . . that's the post. 🤣

Just kidding! 😜 This is us going to our local coffee shop to get a babycino and marshmallow for her, and my heart can't deal with it!! I have pretty much the same routine every weekend, and it involves lots of family, friends, Arna, and a whole lot of coffee! ☕🤣

We always do our friends and family breakfast at either of our two favourite cafes in Adelaide, so we can all just sit down and catch up about our weeks over delicious food. Arna is normally running around having the best time, which means someone always has to be on the lookout for ‘Arna Patrol’ (basically just keeping her out of trouble). 🤣

I’ll normally spend the rest of the day cleaning whilst Arna sleeps, seeing my grandparents for more coffee, and then heading to dinner at my parent’s house. Then, it’s movie night and bed! Very low key weekend - it’s probably very different to other people’s weekends, but it feels wholesome and I love it 😝

#SWKcommunity, I want to hear how you spend your weekends off! Share it with the community below 👇

I AM CONSISTENT.
I AM STRONG.
I AM DETERMINED.
I AM FEARLESS.

AND I AM SO PROUD OF ALL OF YOU LADIES!! 🧡

I have absolutely LOVED seeing all of you sharing your #SweatMade stories! 😍It's not all just about the physical changes you get from fitness, it's about how you FEEL about yourself, and being proud of that! Even more than this, I love that you ladies are reflecting on yourselves, and putting a spotlight on your own #SweatMade words. I want you to be giving your self-worth a workout at the same time, and sometimes we don't take the time to take a look at how we have grown along the journey. 

I want you to feel as good on the inside as you do on the outside! And I want you to be proud of everything that you have worked towards, and celebrate that!! 

YOU ARE ALL THESE #SWEATMADE WORDS AND MORE!! I want to see YOUR #SweatMade stories, so keep it going #SWKCommunity 🙌

20,"Strength comes in so many forms, both physically and mentally. Lifted that new PB you didn’t think you could do? Finally mastered your pushups? Got that full chin-up you have been trying to do for months? Got your first full burpee? INCREDIBLE!! 

However, the physical changes that have happened might be why you started, but it's definitely not all you've gained. Training builds your strength, but it also brings out your determination, perseverance, your confidence in your abilities, and your power. It's getting that big rush of endorphins at the end of your workout, the feeling of pride when you know you've smashed a goal, your determination when you think you just can't get one more rep in. 

I want you to feel PROUD when you achieve these things, no matter how big or how small your goal is.

YOU worked hard to get to this point. YOU kept going when it wasn't always easy. 

YOU did this ❤️

21,"As a personal trainer, I am lucky enough to see women work towards their goals every single day. 

I love that I can be a small part of someone's journey. To encourage, to support and to motivate my clients and community in search of a better, stronger you.

Over the years, I've seen sweat, smiles, tears, and moments of disbelief when new potential is unlocked. 

I've celebrated with you. 

Cried with you. 

And pushed through painful workouts with you.

Whether you train with me in person, or in the @Sweat app... I am always here to cheer you on, but remember, it is YOU that is doing the work.

YOU are the one showing up for your workout.

YOU are the one pushing past the excuses.

YOU are the one that is achieving the 'impossible' and unlocking new potential.

Honestly, YOU are the reason @Sweat exists. And YOU are the core of what #SweatMade is all about. 

As your personal trainer, I want to help as many of you ladies as possible on this journey.

Because the best version of you, she's waiting to sweat.

I am #SweatMade. Are you?
