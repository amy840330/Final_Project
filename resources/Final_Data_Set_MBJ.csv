If you donâ€™t think eight inches of difference is a lot when measuring cars, itâ€™s enough for most manufacturers to use nomenclature like â€œLWB.â€ In this photo, the Bronco is parked four feet from my garage door and the tailgate made impact when opened. I am digging the Bronco so far, but this is pretty poor design for usability, especially considering the pressurized hydraulics open it all the way (like a vertical tailgate).

The fact is, your customers are the most important component to your business. With that said, the sooner you know who they are, the sooner youâ€™ll be able to help resolve their pain points and resonate with them, both through your marketing efforts and through the products/services youâ€™re selling.

If you havenâ€™t pinpointed your customer base yet, set aside some time to do so. Youâ€™ll be one step ahead of your competitors once you do.",,,,,,,,,,,

In light of my mistakes, however, I wanted to come up with a way where I could help other entrepreneurs avoid making the same mistakes. Thatâ€™s when the idea for Daymond on Demand was born.

Daymond on Demand is full of interactive courses that will help you learn about everything from starting and scaling your business to mastering social media.

I hope each and every one of you benefits from this and that it sets you up to be in a better position than when you started.

Ask yourself today- Whatâ€™s your dream? Who else believes in you? And what is holding you back?Â

I was cracking up when listening to it, but in a larger sense, her experience shows that not only is FUBU meaningful to our customers, but itâ€™s also a way to bring people together who may not know what we stand for.

Sure, it served as a way to get a conversation started, but the discussion that Tiffany had with this guy was centered around FUBU being black-owned and truly for the community, and itâ€™s so impactful to us that she remembers this story and sent it our way.

It's not just all mountain climbers and ab bikes in this program! I've included some of my favourite and most challenging ab exercises into this program, to focus on working that core in a high intensity format. You can complete all of these exercises at home with minimal equipment, which means no excuses to get those abs burning!! ðŸ”¥

Here are my 5 advanced ab exercises from HIIT Cardio & Abs:

ðŸ’¥Ab Bike & Toe Tap
ðŸ’¥Dumbbell Bent-Leg Jackknife
ðŸ’¥Commando & Side Plank
ðŸ’¥Decline Shoulder Tap
ðŸ’¥Extended Plank

On set shooting some more ab workouts from my new Cardio & Abs program earlier this week! ðŸ“¸ ðŸ™Œ One thing I have noticed is that I get SO many requests from people asking for 'ab finishes' to do AFTER their workouts because ab exercises were left behind....

Core strength is absolutely fundamental when working out, so it just made sense to make it a major part of my new HIIT Cardio & Abs program!

Not to mention, my FAVOURITE thing about core strength is that it will actually help you feel stronger when completing other exercises too! ðŸ¤©

There's no better feeling than feeling the burn in your core during a sweaty HIIT workout... and if you agree, then my new program is for YOU!

That's it . . . that's the post. ðŸ¤£

Just kidding! ðŸ˜œ This is us going to our local coffee shop to get a babycino and marshmallow for her, and my heart can't deal with it!! I have pretty much the same routine every weekend, and it involves lots of family, friends, Arna, and a whole lot of coffee! â˜•ðŸ¤£

We always do our friends and family breakfast at either of our two favourite cafes in Adelaide, so we can all just sit down and catch up about our weeks over delicious food. Arna is normally running around having the best time, which means someone always has to be on the lookout for â€˜Arna Patrolâ€™ (basically just keeping her out of trouble). ðŸ¤£

Iâ€™ll normally spend the rest of the day cleaning whilst Arna sleeps, seeing my grandparents for more coffee, and then heading to dinner at my parentâ€™s house. Then, itâ€™s movie night and bed! Very low key weekend - itâ€™s probably very different to other peopleâ€™s weekends, but it feels wholesome and I love it ðŸ˜

My NEW HIIT Cardio & Abs program has just launched in the Sweat app, and I cannot wait for you all to try it!!

If you are looking for a challenge, these workouts have been designed with you in mind! It's fast, it's quick, but it's definitely not easy! This program is perfect for completing at home with minimal equipment, but you can absolutely complete this in the gym too. These exercises focus on strengthening your core, so get ready to feel the burn! 

Here are my 5 FAVOURITE AB exercises from my new program, that will definitely give your core a workout:

ðŸ’¥ Flutters
ðŸ’¥ Russian Twist
ðŸ’¥ Alternating Jackknife
ðŸ’¥ Side Plank & Oblique Crunch
ðŸ’¥ X Mountain Climbers

I think my abs are actually on fire after these exercises ðŸ¤£

May be an image of text that says 'Being fit, healthy, it's only part of the story. Training isn't just about building a strong body, it's about giving you self self-worth a workout.'.","Strength comes in so many forms, both physically and mentally. Lifted that new PB you didnâ€™t think you could do? Finally mastered your pushups? Got that full chin-up you have been trying to do for months? Got your first full burpee? INCREDIBLE!! 

However, the physical changes that have happened might be why you started, but it's definitely not all you've gained. Training builds your strength, but it also brings out your determination, perseverance, your confidence in your abilities, and your power. It's getting that big rush of endorphins at the end of your workout, the feeling of pride when you know you've smashed a goal, your determination when you think you just can't get one more rep in. 

I want you to feel PROUD when you achieve these things, no matter how big or how small your goal is.

YOU worked hard to get to this point. YOU kept going when it wasn't always easy. 

YOU did this â¤ï¸

I love that I can be a small part of someone's journey. To encourage, to support and to motivate my clients and community in search of a better, stronger you.

Over the years, I've seen sweat, smiles, tears, and moments of disbelief when new potential is unlocked. 

I've celebrated with you. 

Cried with you. 

And pushed through painful workouts with you.

Whether you train with me in person, or in the @Sweat app... I am always here to cheer you on, but remember, it is YOU that is doing the work.

YOU are the one showing up for your workout.

YOU are the one pushing past the excuses.

YOU are the one that is achieving the 'impossible' and unlocking new potential.

Honestly, YOU are the reason @Sweat exists. And YOU are the core of what #SweatMade is all about. 

As your personal trainer, I want to help as many of you ladies as possible on this journey.

Because the best version of you, she's waiting to sweat.

I am #SweatMade. Are you?

Here I have a program for you to get an excellent triceps workout.
Today you can do this as a routine (4 sets), and next triceps day do this as a circuit (if the gym is not too crowded), and do the circuit 4 times.
